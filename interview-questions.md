# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is like a command that is reusable. If you create a function you only have to do it once and whenever you need that specific command you can refference that function instead of typing out a whole new command.

  Researched answer: a relation from a set of inputs to a set of possible outputs where each input is related to exactly one output. functions are reusable.


2. What is the difference between .map() and .filter()?

  Your answer: .map() is used to find the order or to locate an datatype in an array and .filter() is used to filter out things inside of an array if you want a specific return.

  Researched answer:Python difference between filter() and map()
In contrast map evaluates the function expression and returns back the result as items. So filter always expects its function to do comparison type of task to filter out the elements while map expects its functions to evaluate a statement to get some result.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: a return is a single command, your telling javascripot what action to take. another example would be like alert. return basically returns the info that is given once it has ran through the code that its supoose to. and console.log() is used to log the code and run it through terminal to see if it works ( you have to have a return in there so that when you console.log() the computer knows to return the info to you.)

  Researched answer:The main purpose of the return value, is to use the function return value like you would have use a variable value. the console. log(); is a function (you can see the brackets) that will write the argument value on the console. And only the debuging console, in a browser you will not see anything on the screen.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: an argument is what takes the place inside of a function. it what the function is basing its code on. you can write what you want a function to do but you have to give it an argument so that it knows to run it past the argument and see if the argument is true, and if so, then you will get the result your expecting.

  Researched answer: In mathematics, an argument of a function is a value that must be provided to obtain the function's result. It is also called an independent variable.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:when pair programming, one person is the driver. the driver is the one typing. the other person takes the role of the Navigator. the navigator is telling the driver what to type. both programmers are still putting their inputs in and rubber ducking off one another but the navigator is the one thats saying " ok so then lets type this and see if it works" so basically if we were driving a car the navigator would be the GPS or the one telling me which street to turn on.

  Researched answer:  Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



6. What is iteration?

  Your answer: iteration is breaking down an array and turning it into a string.

  Researched answer:repeating steps, or instructions, over and over again. this is often called a loop.



7. What are advantages and disadvantages for using terminal commands to interact with your computer?

  Your answer:the advantages are that you can access a previous version of a file or undo a change on a file. the disadvantages are that you can also mess up a file or project pretty bad if you're not on the correct folders or if you create a file inside of a folder and then go into a different folder thinking the file is in that one, or if you get lost in the terminal. its easy to get lost and not know what your doing.

  Researched answer:

  Advantages--- This type of interface needs much less memory (RAM) in order to use compared to other types of user interfaces	

'Disadvantages ----- Commands have to be typed precisely. If there is a spelling error the command will fail



8. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: pair programming is super helpful. there were times when i didnt really understand a concept and when we broke out into our pairs, me and my partner would work together (rubber duck) to learn and understand the concept and then apply it to solve our challenges. it helped with understanding things when you have someone to talk to.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest: test runner in javasript
- Test Driven Development: testing software before it is written.
- Classes: contains data & methods and saves as a blueprint for objects. contains data.
- React: javascript library for creating UI.
- React State: built in object in REACT.
- CRUD: Create Read Update Destroy
